## Installation

Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/MattLdwig/FreeCodeCamp_Random-Quotes-and-Colors`

Start with `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## How it works

All quotes are contained in an array in the app's state. Same for all the colours ðŸŽ¨ used as backgrounds.

When you click on the button `Inspire Me` or press the **space key** on your keyboard, a random quote and a random color are selected and displayed on the screen.

The computation of the complementary colors is done by the [color.js](https://github.com/mbjordan/Colors) library.
